# Cravezy

Cravezy is a full stack takeaway ordering application that allows users to order customizable burgers, pizzas, and other menu items from a restaurant. Inspired by a personal experience with a local burger joint, this project aims to provide a smooth ordering experience while addressing the limitations of the existing system.

## Structure

Cravezy is built with Turborepo to efficiently manage the multiple apps in this repo. The project contains the following modules:

- `client` The frontend of the project, built using Vite(React + Typescript)
- `server` The backend of the project, built using Express
- `docs` A documentation of the API plus other functions/components, built Nextra (coming soon)
